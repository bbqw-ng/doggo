Hello! My name is Jolin Jiang, I'm a first-year Computer Science student
at Drexel University on the 5-year track. I have previous experience with
HTML and am currently learning Python and it's frameworks, such as flask
and SQL. I'm in a team working on a project for a website that allows users
to book dog walkers at ease.
