Hi! My name is Brian Wang and I am a first year majoring in Software Engineering.
I have previous experience in Java and some HTML. Currently, I am learning 
Python and a Python micro-framework called Flask. I hope to learn more frameworks
and libraries to build upon my previous experience by the end of the year.
