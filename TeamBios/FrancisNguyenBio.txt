Hello! My name is Francis Nguyen, I'm a first-year Software Engineering student at Drexel University.
I am currently learning back-end Python frameworks such as Flask, database management using SQL, along with CSS 
and UI frameworks on Bootstrap and Vue JS. My teammates and I are cooking up an innovative dog walking website, 
where users can find other people's profiles and hire other users to walk their own dog.
